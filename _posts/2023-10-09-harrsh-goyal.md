{: .box-note}
CP violation was first discovered in Kaons which shattered the 'mirror' of physics once again, and since then Kaons have become synonymous with the concept of CP violation. To measure the same, a new experiment has been proposed at CERN bearing the name 'High-Intensity Kaon Experiments' or HIKE for short, and I was invited to help design the experiment and test its validity, and thus the talk will contain everything from the theory to the tested viability of the experiment thus far. If time permits, will include an additional surprise.
