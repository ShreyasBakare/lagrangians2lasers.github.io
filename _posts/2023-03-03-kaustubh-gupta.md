Measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB) indicate the presence of a dipole anisotropy in the sky distribution of temperature fluctuations of the CMB photons. We believe that the CMB dipole arises because of the earth's motion with respect to the cosmic rest frame; hence, the strength of the dipole provides an estimate of the earth's speed. A similar measurement recently performed using the sky distribution of distant quasars yielded a value for the earth's speed in tension with that inferred from the CMB. We expect an equivalent dipole in the sky and mass distribution of gravitational-wave sources. In this talk, I introduce the framework of Hierarchical Bayesian inference and motivate how we can potentially use a population of merging compact binaries to resolve this budding cosmological tension.
