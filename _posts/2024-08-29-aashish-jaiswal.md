"Two physically different states of a classical system are in principle distinguishable. But that is not always true for quantum mechanical systems.
\
\
I will discuss why is it not possible to distinguish states of a quantum system which are non-orthogonal, everytime with absolute certainty. I will then discuss a optimal distinction procedure involving non-standard measurements."
