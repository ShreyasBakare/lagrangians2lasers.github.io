{: .box-note}
I will give a motivation for why thin films are interesting and worth studying and growing. I will then talk about the various ways in which we can grow thin films and the merits and demerits of each technique. I will also talk about the parameters used to characterize a thin film and how they are measured in practice. I will also discuss some applications of thin films at the end.
