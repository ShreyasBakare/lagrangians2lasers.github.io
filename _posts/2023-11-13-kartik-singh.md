{: .box-note}
Because of the sheer distance at which Quasars are found, the methods employed to measure the mass of their central black hole are very indirect. One such method is reverberation mapping, which achieves this by analyzing the spectrum of these galaxies.
\
I will briefly cover the basic terminology/theory concerning Quasars, and then talk about what reverberation mapping is and how it is implemented.
