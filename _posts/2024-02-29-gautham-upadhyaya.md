Throughout history, precise measurement has been crucial in gaining a deeper understanding of the nature of things and even rewriting the laws of physics. The science of measuring with extreme precision is fascinating in itself, but what's equally intriguing is the physics and research behind the development of instruments that enable such precise measurements. The technology that emerges from this process advances metrology and has real-world applications that significantly impact our lives.
\
\
In this talk, I will discuss the challenges of developing one such precision instrument - an ultra-stable laser and why it's such an impressive accomplishment. I'll also provide an overview of the design of a critical component responsible for the laser's stability. Lastly, we'll explore some examples of the technology's far-reaching implications.
