The Langmuir probe is the most fundamental diagnostics technique for extracting plasma parameters such as electron temperature, plasma density, and plasma potential. I will explain how I analyzed the Langmuir probe data of RF-produced plasma. I will also discuss an analysis code, developed and implemented on Langmuir probe characteristics to extract the plasma parameters for a range of discharge conditions.
