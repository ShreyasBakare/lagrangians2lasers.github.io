{: .box-note}
I will be talking about the symmetries of conformal theory. Its generators and its action on coordinates, and quantum fields. I will also talk about how conformal theory can fix all the two point and three point functions and something called operator product expansion can even fix four point functions. If time permits, I will also give a glimpse of the CFT in momentum space and what are the subtleties included in momentum space CFT.
