{: .box-note}
I will present a search for microscopic black holes in a like-sign dimuon final state in proton–proton collisions at √s = 8 TeV. The data were collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2012 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb⁻¹. Using a high track multiplicity requirement, 0.6 ± 0.2 background events from Standard Model processes are predicted. I will motivate the search using the Hierarchy Problem and talk about a few possible solutions.
