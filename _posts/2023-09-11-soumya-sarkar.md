{: .box-note}
Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) is one of the four detectors at the Large Hadron Collider(LHC) at CERN, where protons are collided at record COM energies of 13.6 TeV. At CMS, we try to find answers to some of the questions that challenge the Standard Model of particle physics, which is by far the most precise theory of the universe as we know it.

In this talk I will discuss briefly the design of CMS, how data is collected, and how we reconstruct known physics objects and their properties from the collected data. I will also describe how from the reconstructed object, we arrive at the process (theoretically a Feynman diagram) that could have taken place during the collision (for eg. Higgs production). I will also give a very brief description of the kind of analysis we do at CMS.
