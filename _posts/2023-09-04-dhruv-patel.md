{: .box-note}
I will be talking on a very old and still existing problem of protein folding in Statistical Mechanics. My project consisted of using Statistical Mechanics and Graph theory to come up with a theoretical hypothesis which takes into account multi-body interaction and other constraints for potential and we can predict the 3D conformation of protein given any sequence.

There are no biological prerequisites for the talk, and a very basic knowledge of statistical physics will be assumed.
