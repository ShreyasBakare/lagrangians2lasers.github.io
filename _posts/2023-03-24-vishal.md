{: .box-note}
Atomic Force Microscopy is a microscopy technique which uses a physical probe to scan the surface. It can have a high spatial resolution up to fractions of a nm. AFM can also be used to give 3D topography of a surface, nano-scale force manipulations and measuring elasticity and viscoelasticity of a material at nano-scales. In force spectroscopy methods, AFM can have resolutions of up to fractions of a nN. It is a very flexible technique, and can be used on hard or soft, conducting or insulating, transparent or opaque, organic or synthetic materials, or even on living cells or single proteins. AFM can be performed in air, liquid or in ultra high vacuum conditions if required. In this talk I am going to focus on the different modes of AFM and their applications. I will also share a bit about what I am doing in my current project with AFM.
