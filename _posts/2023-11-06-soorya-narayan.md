{: .box-note}
This will be an introductory level talk about the various dark matter models physicists use to explain astrophysical observations. The change in the microphysics of dark matter particles can lead to very different cosmological observations. The talk will mostly be focused on Cold Dark Matter, Self interacting Dark Matter and Warm Dark Matter models. If I have the time I'll also talk about Decaying Dark Matter and Fuzzy Dark Matter models.
